# MachineLearning_RNN_Sin-x-
RNN is used to predict the value of function Sin(x). Because RNN model predicts the value of discrete time, the curve of sin(x) function needs to be discretized in the code. Sin(x) is sampled every other period of time, and the sequence obtained by sampling is the result of discretization.
